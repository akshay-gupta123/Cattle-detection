# Summary :

### Data Preparation : 
Images are scrapped from google, then selected manually based on resolution and annotation ability. **labelImg** tool is used for annotation in darknet format. Total of 2100 images are scrapped and after data cleansing 1575 images in the final dataset.

### Data Splitting : 
80% of total images are in the training set, 8% in the validation set, 12% in the test set. So splitting of data is 1260 in training, 126 in validation and 189 in test set.

### Augmentation : 
For each training image, 2 augmented images are generated using **Albumentations** library . According to study noise has had the most adverse effect on top-1 and top-5 accuracy classification, so we add Gaussian Noise randomly to training images with variance σ = [10, 30] and mean µ = 0 sampled for each channel independently. Blurriness, Shearing, Rotation, Translation, HSV hue and saturation, Scaling, Flip, Mosaic augmentations are used. Among those, bounding-box supportive augmentations are done on bounding-boxes only. Bbox supportive augmentation are those that affect only the bounding box region pixel. So finally 2620 images in the training set.

### Training : 
**Yolov5s** model is selected for training. Training is done in 3 phases, each phase for different resolution so that it generalizes well for small objects as well. Resolutions chosen are 480x480, 640x640 and 960x960. Each phase is divided into 2 parts, one half simple and second half with multi-scale training. Each phase is trained for 100 epochs so each half is trained for 50 epochs. So total training consists of 300 epochs. Multi-scale operation is done using bilinear interpolation. SGD is used as optimizers.

### Result :
|        | Precision | Recall | mAP@0.5 | 
|---     | ---  |---    |---     |
|Train | 95.7 | 94.6 | 94.7 | 
|Validation | 93.3 | 90.1 | 90.3 | 
|Test | 90.9 | 85.6 |86.4 |
